Changes in Doom-PSP v0.04 S.S. b5:

-Compiled against newer version of the PSPSDK

A graphical glitch that periodically occurred in the other versions of 
Doom-PSP v0.04 S.S. has been fixed. Doom runs slightly faster now and the 
graphics have slightly improved.

-Menus changed slightly.

Analog nub works in menus. Holding directional buttons now works to allow
faster navigation through menus.

-Cleared conflict with the default button configuration without config.ini.

-Added overclocking feature

The CPU clock speed can be changed to run at 222 MHz, 266 MHz, or 333 MHz.

Changes in Doom-PSP v0.04 S.S. b4:

-Removed case sensitive WAD lookup.

The last release only worked properly with WAD files with lowercase letters 
in the filename. This release can work with WAD files that have uppercase letters, 
lowercase letters, and also with WAD files that have a mixture of uppercase and 
lowercase letters in the filename.

-Customizable button configuration. Button configuration is read from a text file.

The portion of the program that reads the file mostly remains unchanged from the 
DoomPSP v0.04u1 release. The method by which the buttons are implemented is the 
major difference.

-Added a fix that allows both Unix and Windows formatted text files to be read.

This program outputs the configuration changes to a Unix formatted text file.
The original code only allowed Windows formatted text files to work properly so 
the output data made by this program could not be read by the program.

-Added a button configuration submenu.

You can edit the button configuration while running the program. The changes 
can be saved to the configuration text file within the menu. To enter the submenu, 
press the L Trigger + the R Trigger + START. The layout of the menu is a little jank. 
You have to select which action you want to change from the right side and then press 
which button you want to be associated with the action. A swap will occur and the 
button that was highlighted will take the action of whatever the previous button had. 
Also, to switch from analog movement to using the DPad, you can select either 
choice in the menu and press any button to swap the two actions.

Changes in Doom-PSP v0.04 S.S. b3:

-Fixed an error with malloc not allocating enough memory for the strings 
 containing the locations of any WAD files. This would only effect people 
 trying to build the program from source. I honestly don't know how this 
 error didn't appear in the binary; I could have sworn that I did a make clean 
 before making the final build.

-Finally added the m_menu.c file that should have been included with 
 the previous version source code. Without this file, a save file 
 could not be read or detected.

-Added a WAD selector.

Changes in Doom-PSP v0.04 S.S. b2:

Minor fix to enable the use of the corrupt data icon fix. 
The folder that Doom-PSP is linked to is dynamically linked 
now enabling the fix to work and for Doom-PSP not to be confined 
to being stored in PSP\GAME\DOOM-PSP.

Changes in Doom-PSP v0.04 S.S.:

The shoulder buttons are used to strafe, the square button is

used for movement and the analog nub is used for weapon selection.
